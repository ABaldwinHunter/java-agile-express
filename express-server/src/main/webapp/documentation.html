               <h3>Install</h3>
               <p>
                  Download the latest war file and deply it to your favourite servlet container. The latest build
                  is tested on Tomcat 6.0.20 but there is no reason why it would have problems on any 2.4 compliant
                  servlet container.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Express requires a relational database. By default is uses postgres and was developed against 8.4.
                  It will work against most relational databases as persistence is done via JPA and database management
                  through Liquibase. In order to use a different database, at this stage, you will need to add the 
                  database driver to the lib directory and change the properties accordingly (see config section below).
               </p>
               <h3>Configure</h3>
               <p>
                  Most configuration is done in the application.properties file which is located in the exploded war
                  file under WEB-INF/classes.
               </p>
               <h3>Use</h3>
               <h4>Register</h4>
               <p>
                  The fist thing you will need to do is register an user account. User registration can be reached from
                  the link on the login page. An email, password, and password hint is all that is required but additional
                  details such as the colour you want to see for your stories / tasks, your full name and contact phone
                  can be added also to help others in your team(s) identify you.
               </p>
               <p>
               	  After registering an email with a confirmation link will be sent to the email address provided. this link
                    will need to be used in order to activate the account. After this is done you can login.
               </p>
               <h4>Create a project</h4>
               <p>
               	On your first login you will be directed to the project creation / access page. Here you can create a project
                  or request to join an existing one. Your request will be emailed to the project manager(s) immediately but 
                  you will not actually get acess to their project until they have acted on the request. If you create a new
                  project it will be setup immediately and you can go to work on it straight away.
               </p>
               <p>
                  When you create a project you automatically become it's manager. This means you recieve all requests to join
                  the project and can approve or reject them.
               </p>
