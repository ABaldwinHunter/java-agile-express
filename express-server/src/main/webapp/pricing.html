               <h3>Community / Open Source - Free!</h3>
               <p>
                  Express will always be free for open source projects and projects with a user base
                  of 5 or less. Redredred makes extensive use of open source frameworks and feels
                  strongly that it's products should remain free to the open source community.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Small projects are also welcome to use Express free of charge. If the project accepts
                  more than 5 workers including the project admin, then all users must pay the standard
                  rate. Also if project workers join a second project then they must also pay the
                  standard fee.
               </p>
               <h3>Individual - $7/month or $60/year</h3>
               <p>
                  Individual license is required for a user when their project team is larger than five
                  people or a team member wants to work on multiple projects. Team members with
                  this license still count toward the 5 worker limit on a project, however they are
                  free to work on, or manage, as many projects as they like.
               </p>
               <h3>Enterprise - $5/month or $50/year</h3>
               <p>
                  The Enterprise license is available when 20 or more licenses are bought at the
                  same time. Under this license users can manage any number of projects and have
                  any noumber of workers on their projects.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This license represents excellent value for companies which are using Express
                  across all development.

               <h3>Free Usage!</h3>
               <p>
                  Express is currently offering the use of our service absolutely free while we get
                  things off the ground and increase our feature base. This introductory free period
                  will likely come to an end around the Q4 2009.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Even once Express moves to a paid model, you'll always get a month free to try us
                  out, plus certain usage levels of our service will always be free! So please take
                  advantage of this period and try out our service, we think you will be happy to stay
                  on even when your usage gets to the point of requiring payment.
